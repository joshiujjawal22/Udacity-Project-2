# Landing Page Project



Starter code taken from udacity [fend](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

It uses javascript to dynamically create navbar links based on the content, when a section is in the viewport it show the active state of that section.


During the scrolling the navbar is automatically hidden and showed according the direction of the scrolling.
